### Investigación Matemática y Numérica de la ecuación de Lane-Emden.


The solution to the Lane-Emden equation describes a family of static solutions to the Euler-Poisson system for a spherically symmetric, non-relativistic, self-gravitating, polytropic fluid. The most common form of the Lane-Emden equation is y'' + (2/x)y' + y^n = 0; y(0)=1; y'(0)=0. It is well-known that exact analytic solutions can only be obtained for the cases n=0,1,5. However, there exist several numerical methods to solve this equation. The goal of this Bachelor thesis is to analyse and compare two numerical methods, that are based on the Chebyshev pseudospectral method: the successive linearisation method (SLM) and the quasi-linearisation method or Newton-Kantorovich method (QLM). Both of them transform the original problem into a non-linear eigevalue problem.
